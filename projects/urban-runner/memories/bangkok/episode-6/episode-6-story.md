## üèÅ Title  
**Episode 6: Sewer City Hustle**  

## üó∫Ô∏è Story Recap  
What started as a simple plan for a smoothie and Decathlon turned into one of the wildest Urban Runner episodes yet.  

After fueling up with smoothies and juice at **LTB ‚Äì License to Blend**, energy kicked in, shifting the plan: instead of heading to Decathlon, the run went straight into the park, across **Sewer City**, and through into the other side for a heavy outdoor gym workout.  

Checkpoint cards highlighted the **Sewer City entrance** and the **open-air weightlifting session** where the **Level Up card** marked the progress. Tattoos, sweat, and street energy all fed into the mission. A small water purchase (20 baht) added realism to the grind.  

Recovery shifted into fuel again at **El Gaucho Argentinian Steakhouse**, where a perfectly cooked filet trio turned into a **high-priced tourist tax card**. A QR-coded checkpoint tied the location directly into the story.  

On the way home, redistribution missions completed:  
- 100 baht given to a man selling flowers who asked for food.  
- Another 100 baht to a man with a cup on the street.  
These became **Drop Cards**, expanding the wealth redistribution mechanic in-game.  

Back at HYDE, the **Mission Complete card** sealed the day with the shoe-off recovery ritual, stinky Vibrams left on the balcony with air freshener.  

But Episode 6 didn‚Äôt stop there‚ÄîBangkok at night took over. The **Amsterdam Caf√© cutscene** became a highlight:  
- Smoothies, joints, food, reggae vibes.  
- The quirky twist where the server became the ‚Äúweed dealer.‚Äù  
- A 5-panel comic recap was born, embedding Amsterdam into Urban Runner lore.  

From there, the run evolved into late-night Bangkok energy: malls, Decathlon purchases (massage tools, recovery gear), family catch-ups, and ending the night stuffed with food and banana split at **Kinnaree**.
