# Urban Runner 🏃‍♂️

## Vision
A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

## Project Overview
Urban Runner is a **global movement + game universe** created by Paul that blends real-world runs, wealth redistribution, lifestyle stops, and community storytelling into a gamified system. Runs are documented through photos, videos, live WhatsApp updates, stylized game cards, cutscenes, and game maps.

## Core Mission
A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

Each run (episode) includes:
- **Fuel-ups** (food, drinks, coffee)
- **Checkpoints** (parks, gyms, activities)
- **Redistribution drops** (donations, tips)
- **Side events** (volleyball, wildlife encounters)
- **Recovery** (massage, home)

Runners spend, donate, or tip along the way; totals are logged at the end.
Each episode produces game cards + cutscenes + a final mission map.

## Episode Structure
- **Runs are treated as episodes** (e.g., Episode 4 – Bangkok Botanical Run)
- Each episode = a path of checkpoints with a final recovery point
- Side events can be included as bonus cards
- At the end: Mission Complete card + map summary

## Checkpoint Card System
Each stop becomes a stylized card with:

1. **Main photo/video** = central focus (stylized into Urban Runner game world)
2. **Bottom-right tag** → Activity (Fuel Up, Park Run, Gym, Donation, Tip, Bonus, Recover, Volleyball, etc.)
3. **Bottom-left corner** → Amount spent, shown as in-game local cash bill (e.g., 425 ฿)
4. **Minimalist GTA-style look**:
   - No headers
   - No checkpoint numbers
   - No episode text unless it adds clarity
   - Just the photo + activity tag + cash overlay
5. **Effects/boosts** → Optional flavor text (e.g., + Stamina ⚡ | + Focus 👀 | + Endurance 🏃‍♂️)
6. **Background** → Dark theme for strong contrast in WhatsApp

## Spend Type System
- 🛒 **Item Purchase (Blue)** → food, drinks, coffee, fuel
- 🤝 **Donation (Green)** → direct giving
- ✨ **Tip (Gold)** → service staff or vendors
- 💵 **Always shown as cash bills** bottom-left

## Maps
At the end of each episode:
- **Google Maps GPS timeline** shared by Paul
- **Game Map Overlay** created:
  - Base layer = real city streets from Google Maps
  - Route traced (running = blue solid, car = dashed green)
  - Checkpoints marked with icons + spend type tags
  - Totals displayed in corner (Distance, Time, Cash Spent, Cash Given)
  - Repeated routes glow brighter to show game world getting "more detailed" with more footage

## Cutscenes
- **Videos used as cutscenes** in the game world
- **Mechanic**: Switch between real footage 🎥 and game-world render 🎮 with glitch/pixel transitions
- **Marked as "Cutscene Unlocked 🎬"** with thin progress bar
- Can be placed between checkpoints or at episode start/end for atmosphere

## Flow of a Run (Episode)
1. **Start**: Budget + intention declared
2. **Checkpoints**: Each stop gets a card (Fuel Up, Drop, Gym, etc.)
3. **Bonus events**: Optional encounters (wildlife, shortcuts, extra footage)
4. **Cutscenes**: Inserted where longer videos add atmosphere
5. **Final Recovery**: Closing card at massage/home
6. **Mission Complete**: Episode summary with totals + game map

## Community Posting (WhatsApp)
- **Live**: Share real photos, videos, and location updates
- **After**: Post stylized cards, cutscenes, and final map for recap
- **Community description** (pinned):
  > 🌍 Urban Runner
  > A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

## Globe Integration
This project creates globe pins for:
- **Running Routes**: Every episode creates a route pin on the globe
- **Checkpoints**: Each fuel-up, donation, and activity location
- **Spending Patterns**: Wealth redistribution visualization
- **Episode Maps**: Game world overlays on real geography

## Tech Stack (Based on ChatGPT Context)
- **Content Creation**: Photo/video stylization tools
- **Map Integration**: Google Maps API for route visualization
- **Card Generation**: Automated checkpoint card creation
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Community posting and updates
- **Globe Integration**: Connects to main paulvisciano.github.io globe

## Current Status
- **Started**: 5 days ago in Bangkok, Thailand
- **Development**: All planning and system design through ChatGPT
- **Status**: System architecture complete, Episode 4 executed
- **Latest Episode**: Episode 4 - Bangkok Botanical Run (Aug 31, 2025)
- **Next**: Continue building the game world with future episodes

## AI Memory Integration
- **Project Context**: Complete episode system and game mechanics
- **Globe Integration**: How running routes and checkpoints appear on globe
- **Cross-Project Learning**: How this gamified approach connects to travel and other projects
- **Development Context**: All ChatGPT conversations and system design decisions

## Impact Metrics
- **Wealth Redistributed**: Track donations and tips across episodes
- **Global Coverage**: Cities and countries where episodes occur
- **Community Engagement**: WhatsApp group participation and sharing
- **Game World Growth**: How detailed the virtual world becomes with repeated routes

## Future Conversations Rule
Each new conversation = one Urban Runner episode. Follow this system to generate cards, maps, and cutscenes based on Paul's inputs (photos, videos, spend notes, routes).
