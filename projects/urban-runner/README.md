# Urban Runner üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Vision
Global wealth redistribution through running, augmented reality, and community impact.

## Project Overview
Urban Runner is a revolutionary project that combines:
- **Physical Activity**: Running in urban areas around the world
- **Wealth Redistribution**: Donating money while running to reduce global inequality
- **Augmented Reality**: AR game elements that make running engaging and social
- **Global Impact Tracking**: Visualizing wealth redistribution on the globe

## Started
- **Date**: Started 5 days ago in Bangkok, Thailand
- **Location**: Bangkok (current base)
- **Development**: All initial development through ChatGPT conversations
- **Status**: Concept and initial planning phase

## Globe Integration
This project creates globe pins for:
- **Running Routes**: Every run creates a route pin on the globe
- **Donation Locations**: Places where wealth redistribution occurs
- **AR Game Sessions**: Augmented reality interactions
- **Community Events**: Group runs and donation drives

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with donation tracking
- **AR**: ARKit/ARCore integration
- **Globe Integration**: Connects to main paulvisciano.github.io globe
- **Blockchain**: Transparent donation tracking

## Impact Metrics
- **Wealth Redistributed**: Track total donations and impact
- **Running Distance**: Global running coverage
- **Community Engagement**: Number of participants
- **AR Game Adoption**: Social gaming metrics

## Development Context
- **ChatGPT Conversations**: All initial development documented in ChatGPT
- **Need**: Import ChatGPT context into project memory
- **Next Steps**: Set up project structure and import development context

## AI Memory Integration
- **Project Context**: Urban Runner development decisions and progress
- **Globe Integration**: How running routes and donations appear on globe
- **Cross-Project Learning**: How this connects to travel and other projects
