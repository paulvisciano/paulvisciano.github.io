# Urban Runner Project Instructions

Urban Runner is a global movement + game universe created by Paul. It blends real-world runs, wealth redistribution, lifestyle stops, and community storytelling into a gamified system. Runs are documented through photos, videos, live WhatsApp updates, stylized game cards, cutscenes, and game maps.

---

## Core Mission

A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

Each run (episode) includes fuel-ups, checkpoints, redistribution drops, side events, and recovery.

Runners spend, donate, or tip along the way; totals are logged at the end.

Each episode produces game cards + cutscenes + a final mission map.

---

## Episode Structure

Runs are treated as episodes (e.g. Episode 4 – Bangkok Botanical Run).

Each episode = a path of checkpoints with a final recovery point.

Side events (like volleyball, bonus wildlife encounters) can be included as bonus cards.

At the end, a Mission Complete card + map summary is posted.

---

## Checkpoint Card System

Each stop becomes a stylized card.

**Rules:**

1. **Main photo/video** = central focus (stylized into Urban Runner game world).

2. **Bottom-right tag** → Activity (Fuel Up, Park Run, Gym, Donation, Tip, Bonus, Recover, Volleyball, etc.).

3. **Bottom-left corner** → Amount spent, shown as in-game local cash bill (e.g., 425 ฿).

4. **Minimalist GTA-style look**:
   - No headers
   - No checkpoint numbers
   - No episode text unless it adds clarity
   - Just the photo + activity tag + cash overlay.

5. **Effects/boosts** → Optional flavor text (e.g. + Stamina ⚡ | + Focus 👀 | + Endurance 🏃‍♂️).

6. **Background** → Dark theme for strong contrast in WhatsApp.

## Spend Type System

🤝 **Donation (Green)** → direct giving
✨ **Tip (Gold)** → service staff or vendors
💵 **Always shown as cash bills** bottom-left

---

## Maps

At the end of each episode, Paul shares his Google Maps GPS timeline.

A **Game Map Overlay** is created:
- Base layer = real city streets from Google Maps
- Route traced (running = blue solid, car = dashed green)
- Checkpoints marked with icons + spend type tags
- Totals displayed in a corner (Distance, Time, Cash Spent, Cash Given)

Repeated routes glow brighter to show the game world getting "more detailed" with more footage.

---

## Cutscenes

Videos are used as cutscenes in the game world.

**Mechanic:** Switch between real footage 🎥 and game-world render 🎮 with glitch/pixel transitions.

Marked as "Cutscene Unlocked 🎬" with a thin progress bar.

Can be placed between checkpoints or at episode start/end for atmosphere.
