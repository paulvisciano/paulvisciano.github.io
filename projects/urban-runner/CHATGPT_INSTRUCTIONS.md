Urban Runner Project Instructions (v5.0 â€“ Comic Page Workflow)

Last Updated: September 17, 2025

Core Mission

A global movement for wealth redistribution â€” one run at a time.
Now told through comic book pages instead of scattered checkpoint cards.

Episode Structure

Each episode is structured as a comic book.

Episode Cover (Page 0) opens the story.

Episode Pages (Page 1 â†’ N) sequentially capture the flow of the adventure.

Final Page = Episode Summary (mission complete recap, maps, totals, etc.).

Page Workflow

Pages replace checkpoints:

Instead of many individual cards, each page integrates multiple beats of the story.

A single page can cover what used to be multiple checkpoints (scene, drop, fuel-up, etc.).

Template-driven: every page uses the same comic template (cream background, bold outlines, footer with Ep.XX pg.Y).

Sequential Numbering:

Cover = Page 0

Episode events = Pages 1 â†’ N

Summary = Last page

Categories (Now Story Elements)

Scenes: Encounters, group dynamics, comedic beats.

Fuel-Ups / Drops: Still appear, but folded into pages (e.g., smoothies, tips, donations shown in-panel).

Side Quests: Woven naturally into page flow as full or half-page beats.

Restaurants & Buildings: Appear as feature pages when central to story.

Cutscenes: Cinematic-style pages (romance, humor, drama) using same template.

Maps

Maps still included, but appear as panels or full pages inside the comic (instead of separate cards).

Source: Google Maps GPS timeline.

Show route with totals (distance, time, cash spent/given).

Narrative

Backstories and narration are embedded directly into the panels with yellow narration boxes.

No separate flip-side text cards needed.

Asset Rules

Episode Number & Page Number must appear in the footer of every page (e.g., Ep.20 pg.6).

File Naming Convention:

ep-XX-page-Y.png

Example: ep-20-page-6.png

Folder Structure:

YYYY/episode-XX/ep-XX-page-Y.png

Episode Flow

Page 0 â†’ Episode Cover

Sequential Story Pages â†’ built from template, merging multiple events into natural comic flow.

Final Page â†’ Episode Summary

Export Rule

Export only the comic pages (cover â†’ summary).

No JSON, story markdowns, or backstory text exports needed.

The comic itself is the deliverable.

ðŸ‘‰ This streamlined workflow means fewer, higher-quality pages per episode, quicker generation, easier exporting, and simpler site integration.
