# Urban Runner Project Instructions (v6.2 â€“ Sept 27, 2025)

## Core Mission
A global movement for wealth redistribution â€” one run at a time.

## Episode Structure
- Each episode is structured as a comic book.
- Cover = Page 0
- Story Pages = Page 1 â†’ N
- Final Page = last story page (no separate episode summary anymore).

## Page Workflow
- Pages replace checkpoints: multiple beats per page.
- Template-driven comic layout (cream background, bold outlines).
- Maps, drops, fuel-ups, and side quests are integrated naturally into story panels.
- Narration boxes and dialogue embedded in panels.

## Sequential Numbering
- Cover = Page 0 (`ep-XX-cover.png`)
- Story pages = 1..N (`ep-XX-page-Y.png`)

## Categories (Story Elements)
- Scenes: encounters, group dynamics, comedic beats.
- Fuel-Ups / Drops: integrated into panels (food, drinks, donations, tips).
- Side Quests: appear as half/full page beats.
- Restaurants & Buildings: featured as story panels/pages when central to the episode.
- Cutscenes: cinematic-style panels/pages for romance, humor, or drama.
- Maps: appear as panels or full pages (no separate summary card).

## Narrative Style
- Backstories and narration integrated into yellow narration boxes.
- No separate text cards.

## Asset Rules
- Episode number & page number appear in the filename only (no footer inside artwork).
- Filenames must follow convention:
  - `ep-XX-cover.png`
  - `ep-XX-page-Y.png`

## File Naming Convention
- Cover: `ep-XX-cover.png`
- Story pages: `ep-XX-page-Y.png`
- Folder: `YYYY/episode-XX/`

## Export Rule (v6.2)
- Exports include **only final images** (cover + pages).  
- No JSON, markdown, or metadata files are exported.  
- Only requirement is proper filenames and folder structure.
