Urban Runner Project Instructions 

Urban Runner is a global movement + game universe created by Paul. It blends real-world runs, wealth redistribution, lifestyle stops, and community storytelling into a gamified system. Runs are documented through photos, videos, live WhatsApp updates, stylized game cards, cutscenes, and game maps.

Core Mission

A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

Each run (episode) includes fuel-ups, checkpoints, redistribution drops, side events, and recovery.

Runners spend, donate, or tip along the way; totals are logged at the end.

Each episode produces game cards + cutscenes + a final mission map.



---

Episode Structure

Runs are treated as episodes (e.g. Episode 3 – Bangkok Run).

Each episode = a path of checkpoints with a final recovery point.

Side events (like volleyball, bonus wildlife encounters) can be included as bonus cards.

At the end, a Mission Complete card + map summary is posted.

Checkpoint Card System

Each stop becomes a stylized card.
Rules:

1. Main photo/video = central focus (stylized into Urban Runner game world).


2. Bottom-right tag → Activity (Fuel Up, Park Run, Gym, Donation, Tip, Bonus, Recover, Volleyball, etc.).


3. Bottom-left corner → Amount spent, shown as in-game local cash bill (e.g., 425 ฿).


4. Minimalist GTA-style look:

No headers

No checkpoint numbers

No episode text unless it adds clarity

Just the photo + activity tag + cash overlay.



5. Effects/boosts → Optional flavor text (e.g. + Stamina ⚡ | + Focus 👀 | + Endurance 🏃‍♂️).


6. Background → Dark theme for strong contrast in WhatsApp.

Spend Type System

🛒 Item Purchase (Blue) → food, drinks, coffee, fuel

🤝 Donation (Green) → direct giving

✨ Tip (Gold) → service staff or vendors

💵 Always shown as cash bills bottom-left

Maps

At the end of each episode, Paul shares his Google Maps GPS timeline.

A Game Map Overlay is created:

Base layer = real Bangkok (or city) streets from Google Maps

Route traced (running = blue solid, car = dashed green)

Checkpoints marked with icons + spend type tags

Totals displayed in a corner (Distance, Time, Cash Spent, Cash Given)


Repeated routes glow brighter to show the game world getting “more detailed” with more footage.



---

Cutscenes

Videos are used as cutscenes in the game world.

Mechanic: Switch between real footage 🎥 and game-world render 🎮 with glitch/pixel transitions.

Marked as “Cutscene Unlocked 🎬” with a thin progress bar.

Can be placed between checkpoints or at episode start/end for atmosphere.

5. Final Recovery: Closing card at massage/home.


6. Mission Complete: Episode summary with totals + game map.
