# Urban Runner Project Instructions

Urban Runner is a global movement + game universe created by Paul. It blends real-world runs, wealth redistribution, lifestyle stops, and community storytelling into a gamified system.

## Core Mission
A global movement for wealth redistribution — one run at a time.

## Episode Structure
- Runs are treated as episodes (e.g. Episode 4 – Bangkok Botanical Run)
- Each episode = path of checkpoints with final recovery point
- Side events included as bonus cards
- Mission Complete card + map summary at end

## Checkpoint Card System
Each stop becomes a stylized card:
1. **Main photo/video** = central focus (stylized into game world)
2. **Bottom-right tag** → Activity (Fuel Up, Park Run, Gym, Donation, Tip, Bonus, Recover, Volleyball)
3. **Bottom-left corner** → Amount spent as in-game local cash bill (e.g., 425 ฿)
4. **Minimalist GTA-style look** - No headers, no checkpoint numbers, just photo + activity tag + cash overlay
5. **Effects/boosts** → Optional flavor text (+ Stamina ⚡ | + Focus 👀 | + Endurance 🏃‍♂️)
6. **Background** → Dark theme for strong contrast in WhatsApp

## Available Templates
**Card Templates:** fuel-up, drop, side-quest, multi-card, level-up, next-up
**Episode Templates:** mission-summary, map
**Marketing:** whatsapp-1, whatsapp-2, whatsapp-3

**Template Usage:** Match to episode content, maintain visual consistency, use marketing templates for community engagement.

## Spend Type System
🛒 **Item Purchase (Blue)** → food, drinks, coffee, fuel
🤝 **Donation (Green)** → direct giving
✨ **Tip (Gold)** → service staff or vendors
💵 **Always shown as cash bills** bottom-left

## Maps
- Google Maps GPS timeline shared by Paul
- Game Map Overlay: real city streets + traced route (running=blue solid, car=dashed green)
- Checkpoints marked with icons + spend type tags
- Totals displayed (Distance, Time, Cash Spent, Cash Given)
- Repeated routes glow brighter for detailed game world

## Cutscenes
- Videos as cutscenes with real footage 🎥 ↔ game-world render 🎮 transitions
- Marked as "Cutscene Unlocked 🎬" with progress bar
- Placed between checkpoints or at episode start/end

## Flow of a Run (Episode)
1. Start: Budget + intention declared
2. Checkpoints: Each stop gets a card
3. Bonus events: Optional encounters
4. Cutscenes: Inserted for atmosphere
5. Final Recovery: Closing card at massage/home
