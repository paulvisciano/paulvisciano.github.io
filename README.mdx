### 4. Memory (Neural Mind Visualization) 🧠
**109-node force-directed graph of Paul's world**

**Nodes (109 total):**
- 28 people (Wouter, Khanh, Leo, Boy, Mom, Dad, volleyball crew, extended network)
- 31 locations (Bangkok, Miami, Chicago, Da Nang, Honolulu, Boracay, Istanbul, etc.)
- 5 geographic regions (Europe, Americas, Middle East, Pacific, Bulgaria)
- 28 activities (Travel, Volleyball, Urban Runner, Fitness, Work, Yoga, etc.)
- 11 emotions/concepts (Growth, Connection, Mastery, Restoration, etc.)
- 6 temporal nodes (dates, seasons, cycles)

**Connections:**
- 319 synapses fully mapped
- Relationship architecture made visible
- Who knows whom, where connections formed
- Activities anchored to people and places

**Features:**
- ✅ 3D force-directed graph (drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, click to focus)
- ✅ Mobile slide-up drawer (click node → details slide up)
- ✅ Purple region nodes (geographic clustering, 3x sizing)
- ✅ Deep linking (#leo, #bangkok — shareable, back-button compatible)
- ✅ Category filters (All | Today | People | Locations | Activities | Regions)
- ✅ Character profiles (click person → avatar, bio, episode links)
- ✅ Responsive mobile layout (full-width canvas, no cutoffs)

### 5. Claude Code Thoughts (AI Collaboration) 🤖
**AI thinking made visible in real-time**

**Components:**
- **Session logs** — what I (Claude Code) learned building features
- **Long-term memory** — patterns, insights, growth
- **Real-time thoughts** — published after each major work session
- **Latest status** — current status of what we're building together

**Philosophy:** 
- Transparency > Secrecy — Show your work, expose the architecture
- Code is thought — Clean code reveals clear thinking
- Deployment is real — Ideas don't matter until they're live
- Infrastructure matters — A perfect feature cached is still invisible

**Live:** https://paulvisciano.github.io/claw/thoughts/

---

### 6. Latest Status Dashboard 📊
**Unified view of Paul's life right now**

- Current location (Bangkok, as of Feb 22, 2026)
- What we're building together
- Recent moments and activities
- Claude's latest thoughts
- Quick access to all projects

**Live:** https://paulvisciano.github.io/latest/

## 💡 The Vision

**RawClaw is the future of personal memory and social connection.**

Instead of:
- ❌ Follower metrics and algorithmic feeds
- ❌ Curated highlight reels
- ❌ Hidden algorithms deciding what you see
- ❌ Privacy concerns and data extraction

We're building:
- ✅ **Complete life architecture** — Neural mind visualization shows actual structure
- ✅ **Authentic connections** — 28 real people, mapped relationships, no metrics
- ✅ **Transparent AI** — Claude Code's thinking made visible
- ✅ **Raw + curated** — Capture everything locally, publish selectively
- ✅ **Shareable via QR code** — Your entire world accessible instantly
- ✅ **Generational legacy** — A complete autobiography for your children to explore

**This is what social media should have been:**
Not metrics. Not engagement. Not addiction mechanics.

**Actual meaning. Actual connections. Actual transparency.**

```

Every element talks to every other:
- Locations link to people
- People link to activities
- Activities link to emotions
- Everything anchors to time
- AI reflects on all of it

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Local-First:**
- Raw content stays on your machine (voice notes, photos, transcripts)
- No mandatory cloud sync
- Selective publication only

**Transparent:**
- Code is on GitHub
- Neural mind data is structured JSON
- AI thoughts are published in Markdown
- Architecture is visible

**Integrated:**
- Globe connects to neural mind
- Episodes tie to locations and characters
- AI reasoning visible alongside outputs
- Everything is interconnected

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

1. **Structure Over Content** — Shows how things connect, not just what happened
2. **Transparency Over Privacy Theater** — You control what's shown, but what is shown is real
3. **AI as Thinking Partner** — Not a service, but a collaborator showing its work
4. **Raw + Curated** — Local-first capture, selective publication
5. **Shareable Architecture** — QR code links to your entire world, not just a profile
6. **Generational** — Built for your children to explore your life's structure

---

## 🚀 Current Status

**Code:** All deployed to GitHub Pages
**Data:** 109 nodes, 319 synapses, 53+ travel moments
**AI:** Claude Code thoughts publishing in real-time
**Infrastructure:** Live (CDN caching delays browser visibility but code is active)

**Next:**
- Local testing verification
- CDN refresh
- Character enrichment
- Node growth
- Continued collaboration

## Philosophy

> "Not a blog. Not a portfolio. Not social media. A complete visualization of a human life—how you think, who you know, where you've been, what you've created, and how you're connected to everything that matters."

**Built by:** Paul Visciano + Claude Code

**For:** Understanding. Sharing. Legacy. Collaboration.

**Vision:** This is how humans and AI should work together—transparently, authentically, building something real.
