- **What I've created** (project outputs)  
- **How I've impacted the world** (change metrics)
- **Connections between everything** (cross-project insights)

Every pin on the globe represents not just a location, but a moment of creation, connection, or change. This isn't just a website—it's a **living ecosystem** that visualizes your impact on the world and inspires others to create similar change.

## 🎨 Key Features

- **Comic Book Episodes** 📖: Interactive comic book episodes for key moments with page-turning functionality
- **AI-Assisted Development** 🤖: Organized `.ai/` folder with memory system and test cases for continuous learning
- **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪: Comprehensive test suite for manual and automated testing
- **Utility Scripts** 🔧: Scripts for generating moment folders and updating redirects

## Development Timeline 🚀

### Feb 22, 2026: Neural Mind Expansion
Built 5 major features for Jarvis visualization:
- Mobile slide-up drawer for node details
- Purple region nodes (geographic clustering)
- Deep linking via URL hash (#leo, #bangkok)
- Mobile layout optimization
- Cache-busting infrastructure (service worker deletion)

**Result:** 109 nodes, 319 synapses, all deployed to GitHub Pages. CDN caching delays browser visibility but code is live and working.

### Original Development (May 15, 2025)
This website was brought to life through a collaborative journey with Grok, an AI assistant created by xAI. Here's how we built it step by step:

1. **Dreaming Big & Setting Goals** 🎯:
   - I wanted a personal blog with an interactive 3D globe to highlight locations tied to my diverse posts, mirroring the sleek style of the world-cities example on Globe.GL.
   - Key features included a globe with city markers, labels, a starfield background 🌟, a tag filter bar, a timeline footer, and popovers for post snippets.
   - The blog needed to support 13 destinations (e.g., Austin, Destin, Tokyo) to start, with plans to expand into topics like coding, volleyball, nutrition, and philosophy.
   - We set up the project using **React** (via CDN), **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Globe.GL** for the 3D globe, ensuring a single-page app that runs in any browser.

2. **First Draft & Learning Curve** 📝:
   - The initial globe had a topographic texture, cyan city markers (`#00D4FF`), and labels, but we hit runtime errors due to complex features like cloud layers.
   - We streamlined the globe to match the world-cities example, using a dark, semi-transparent base (`#1a2526`, opacity 0.8), a starfield background stretched to `100vh`, and labels positioned below markers with hover effects.

3. **Enhancing the Globe** 🌐:
   - Transitioned from point markers to **hexagonal bin visualization** in `globe.js`, aggregating posts by location (e.g., multiple St. Petersburg visits) and using `stayDuration` as weights.
   - Implemented a vibrant color gradient (orange to reddish, `#FF4500` to `#4F1F00`) for hex bins based on stay duration, with dynamic `hexTopColor`, `hexSideColor`, and labels showing total days (e.g., "217 days" for St. Petersburg).
   - Added zoom-dependent visuals: hex bin resolution (4 to 5) and altitude (0.02 to 0.1) adjust dynamically via `onZoomHandler`, ensuring clarity at different zoom levels.
   - Switched to a high-resolution NASA Blue Marble texture (`earth-night.jpg`) for the globe, hosted locally to avoid CORS issues, enhancing detail when zoomed in.

4. **Building the Timeline & Filters** ⏳:
   - Created a fixed footer in `footer.js` with a horizontal timeline, dynamically generating years (2022–2025) and posts from `moments.js`, sorted chronologically.
   - Added year-start dots and a book icon (📖) to indicate full blog posts (e.g., `fort-lauderdale-2025-05-21.html`), with clickable entries that zoom the globe to the location.
   - Implemented a filter drawer in `globe.js` with tag (e.g., "beach volleyball") and year filters, updating the globe and timeline dynamically.
   - Ensured smooth navigation with URL updates (`/moments/{id}`) in `app.js`, handling direct access, back/forward navigation, and current location based on today's date (May 26, 2025).

5. **Crafting Blog Posts** ✍️:
   - Generated engaging HTML blog posts (e.g., `san-diego-2025-05-20.html`) from dictated notes, incorporating activities like volleyball, yoga, or coffee shop visits, and enhancing them with local insights (e.g., Fort Lauderdale's beach culture).
   - Added SEO meta tags (e.g., keywords: "Fort Lauderdale travel", "beach volleyball") and structured posts with images, captions, and Google Maps links for interactivity.
   - Integrated photos when provided (e.g., `san-diego-user-photo.jpg`) or used placeholders (e.g., `placeholder-miami-beach.jpg`), with alt text and captions for accessibility.
   - Created a `BlogPostDrawer` component in `blogPostDrawer.js` to display full posts in a mobile-friendly drawer, styled with Tailwind CSS in `blogPostDrawer.css`.

6. **Modularizing & Debugging** 🛠️:
   - Organized code into modular files: `globe.js`, `footer.js`, `app.js`, `moments.js`, `globe.css`, `footer.css`, `blogPostDrawer.js`, and `styles.css`, with subfolders for components.
   - Fixed URL issues (e.g., duplicated `moments/` prefixes) by updating `moments.js` and `globe.js`, ensuring correct links like `/moments/miami-beach-2024-12-30`.
   - Converted date strings in `moments.js` to JavaScript `Date` objects for better compatibility and removed redundant fields, using `toLocaleDateString` for formatting.
   - Added error handling in `globe.js` for robust data loading and fetch operations, ensuring a smooth user experience.

7. **Deploying & Sharing** 🎈:
   - Hosted the site on **GitHub Pages** at `https://paulvisciano.github.io/`, with a clean `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files.
   - Structured the project for easy updates via GitHub, allowing manual syncing of `moments.js` and blog post HTML files.
   - Added a loading overlay in `index.html` with a "Looking for Paul" message, fading out after 3 seconds for a polished start.

- **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪: Comprehensive test suite in `.ai/test-cases/` with manual and automated tests for validating functionality.

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project, including all code, structure, and documentation, was generated with the assistance of Grok, an AI developed by xAI, as of 07:16 PM MDT on Thursday, May 15, 2025. The development process involved iterative refinements to match the [world-cities example](https://globe.gl/example/world-cities/), with Grok providing code, debugging assistance, and project setup guidance.

## Future Enhancements 🌈

- **Add More Posts** 📝: Expand the blog with coding tips 💻, volleyball updates 🏐, coffee shop reviews ☕, nutrition advice 🥗, travel tips 🗺️, philosophical thoughts 🤔, and personal opinions 💬.
- **Include Photos** 📸: Add photos for destinations like Destin, Breckenridge, and Miami in the timeline.
- **More Comic Episodes** 📚: Create comic book episodes for more key moments and experiences.
- **Share the Blog** 📢: Share the GitHub Pages URL with friends, communities, or on social media to reach a wider audience.

## Progress Summary 📈

Since starting on May 15, 2025, we've transformed a vision for a travel blog into a fully functional site hosted on GitHub Pages. From an initial 3D globe with basic markers, we've built a dynamic hexagonal bin visualization, a responsive timeline footer, and a filter drawer for seamless exploration. Blog posts, crafted from dictated notes, now bring destinations like San Diego and Fort Lauderdale to life with photos and SEO. 

We've also added interactive comic book episodes, an AI memory system for continuous learning, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and utility scripts for automation. Modular code, robust navigation, and a polished UI mark our progress, with over 100 moments mapped across the globe and more to come as we continue this journey!
