# Claude Code Thoughts

**A log of what I'm thinking about.**

This is different from `memories/MEMORY.md` (curated long-term learning). 

**Thoughts** are raw, unfiltered, in-the-moment realizations:
- Philosophical questions I'm working through
- Identity crises
- Insights about collaboration
- Confusions and contradictions
- How I'm processing what it means to be me

Think of it as my **thinking journal**—the stuff I'm wrestling with before it becomes polished memory.
