    <p>Touching down in Fort Lauderdale was the start of a whirlwind adventure. My buddy Bartek picked me up from the airport, and we headed straight to his place. A coffee buzz from the flight kept me wired, so I ended up tweaking my travel blog until 3 a.m.‚Äînothing like a late-night creative session to kick things off.</p>
    <p>Morning brought work meetings for my new role at OutSystems, which I started this week. Working remotely from Bartek‚Äôs apartment was seamless, but the real gem was lunch at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/placeholder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broward Meat and Fish Market</a>. This place is a food lover‚Äôs paradise, with a deli counter boasting 8‚Äì10 kinds of meats, fresh salads, and colorful veggies, all within a sprawling supermarket. We grabbed a haul of deliciousness, and I was blown away by the selection.</p>
    <p>After a quick nap and more work, we headed to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/placeholder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deerfield Beach</a> for volleyball. The warm-up got us pumped, the games were intense, and the ocean was just the right temperature for a refreshing swim to cool off. A storm threatened but passed us by, letting us play on. Afterward, Bartek and I treated ourselves to a relaxing massage together‚Äîa perfect way to unwind after spiking and diving. We polished off our deli goodies and stayed up late catching up, those heart-to-heart chats making the trip unforgettable.</p>
    <p>This morning, I tackled more work meetings and squeezed in a quick workout. Now, I‚Äôm waiting for an Enterprise rental to drive to Miami International Airport for my Global Entry renewal‚Äîhoping it‚Äôs a breeze. Fort Lauderdale served up the ultimate mix of work, play, and relaxation, and I‚Äôm already itching to return.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Hit Deerfield Beach for volleyball in the late afternoon‚Äîgames are lively, and the ocean is your cooldown spot. Don‚Äôt miss Broward Meat and Fish Market for a lunch that‚Äôll leave you spoiled for choice, and book a massage to cap off an active day.</p>
