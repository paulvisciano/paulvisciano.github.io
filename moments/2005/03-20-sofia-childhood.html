        <h2>Wild Teenage Years in Sofia</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p class="date">1994–2004</p>

            <h2>Early Days in the Capital</h2>
            <p>Moving to Sofia at the age of six marked the beginning of what would become a formative chapter in my life. The transition from the coastal vibes of Varna to the bustling energy of Bulgaria's capital city was both exciting and challenging.</p>

            <h2>Early School Days</h2>
            <p>My educational journey in Sofia began at 119th High School, where I spent my first six years of schooling. The school, located in the heart of the city, became my second home. It was here that I first learned to navigate the complexities of city life, making friends and adapting to the structured environment of formal education.</p>

            <h2>The German Connection</h2>
            <p>As I entered my teenage years, my parents made the decision to transfer me to Doris Tenedi German High School. This private institution, known for its rigorous academic standards and emphasis on German language and culture, would become my educational home for grades 7 through 10. The transition wasn't just about changing schools – it was about embracing a new culture and way of learning.</p>

            <h2>Adventures in the City</h2>
            <p>By the time I turned 13, I was already exploring the vibrant nightlife of Sofia. The city's downtown area became our playground, where my friends and I would hang out, discovering the pulse of urban life. We weren't just typical teenagers – we were young explorers, eager to experience everything the city had to offer.</p>

            <h2>Street Soccer and Scars</h2>
            <p>One of my most vivid memories from those years is playing street soccer on concrete courts. We didn't need fancy fields or proper equipment – just a ball and our neighborhood friends. Those intense matches left their mark, quite literally – the scars on my knees still tell stories of spectacular dives and passionate plays. Each scar is a reminder of the carefree days when we played until the street lights came on.</p>

            <h2>Shaping the Future</h2>
            <p>Looking back, those years in Sofia were more than just a period of education and play. They were the foundation of my adventurous spirit and my ability to adapt to new environments. The combination of formal education at two very different schools, the freedom to explore the city, and the friendships formed during those years all contributed to shaping the person I would become.</p>

            <p>The streets of Sofia, with their mix of history and modernity, became my classroom beyond the school walls. Every corner held a new adventure, every friend a new perspective, and every experience a lesson in life. These early years in Sofia weren't just about growing up – they were about growing into myself.</p>
