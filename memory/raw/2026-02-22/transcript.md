## Morning Session (07:00–07:15 GMT+7)

### 07:00 - Good Morning
Good morning

### 07:02 - Sleep & Bai Reflection
They didn't get a ton of sleep, but I woke up, I think, because the sun is coming out. And I'm still thinking about they definitely kind of caught me by surprise, and then it ended up being not a positive experience, I don't know if my ego got hurt or just because I had said expectations, which I know I shouldn't do, but off of all the conversations we had, I thought she was genuinely excited to get to know me, and get a little closer, but it seemed that way she keeps saying that it's a friend, but yeah, I did not enjoy the fact that she was just like.

There are a lot of red flags I shared enough already yesterday, but today I just plan on messaging her to meet up somewhere so I can drop off the money for her, and I'll have a novice conversation with her that I don't think I want to stay in touch.

### 07:03 - Meeting Timeline
It's still really early and she was watching a soccer game after she got back so probably around 11 or noon or something

### 07:06 - Filter UI Feedback
Yes I also had a chance to just review the work you did I'm seeing the UI for the filters which is great and it looks nice but they don't do anything they don't do the actual filtering when clicked only those nodes should stay highlighted and when it comes to like selecting today then maybe even hiding all the other nodes would be good that are not associated with today that way you can get a clear picture of what's been the latest memories

### 07:08 - Memory & Self Understanding
I think memories and thoughts shape a lot of who we are. And I thought that the visualization that we built yesterday is your actual memories. Is that not true?

### 07:09 - Storage Optimization (Raw Content)
Okay so that can be considered the transcript right now you have voice not 70 but then let's also have the raw audio that I just sent you

### 07:11 - Raw Content Organization Confirmed
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're capturing them already because how you're doing the transcribe right now

### 07:14 - Image Storage Request
Nice. Now, can you retroactively go back and organize the content from yesterday in the same way?

### 07:15 - Image Organization Confirmation
Can you move those images I just sent you on the images folder for today

### 07:15 - Screenshot Context
Here is an example of you running from my MacBook Pro and then I have cursor open and that's the folder you just created.

### 07:20 - Transcript Request
I see I was reading the voice notes and it's more of a recap of the voice notes like the audio. What I would like to do instead is have the transcript of the chat. So maybe another file at the root folder for the data has the transcript.
