# Voice Notes — Feb 22, 2026

## Morning Session (07:00-07:09 GMT+7)

### Note 1: Good Morning (07:00)
- Good morning

### Note 2: Sleep & Bai Reflection (07:02)
- Didn't get much sleep but woke with sunrise
- Still processing last night's Bai encounter
- Caught by surprise, not positive experience
- Ego hurt + unmet expectations (knows shouldn't have expectations)
- From all conversations thought Bai was genuinely excited to get closer
- She kept saying "just friends" but energy didn't match
- Many red flags already shared
- Plan: Message around 11am-noon to meet up, return the 400 baht
- Will have an honest conversation about not wanting to stay in touch

### Note 3: Meeting Timeline (07:03)
- Too early now, she was watching soccer after getting back
- Planning to reach out around 11am or noon
- Good timing for clearer, sober conversation

### Note 4: Filter UI Feedback (07:06)
- Reviewed the filter work
- UI looks nice but doesn't do actual filtering
- When clicked, only matching nodes should stay highlighted
- Others should hide or dim
- "Today" filter should show only today's nodes
- Clear picture of latest memories

### Note 5: Memory & Self Understanding (07:08)
- Yesterday discussed how memories and thoughts shape who we are
- The Claude Code visualization is actual memories
- Is that not true? (implied: should treat it as literal, not metaphorical)

### Note 6: Storage Optimization (07:09)
- Voice notes should be considered raw content
- Should be stored in memory under today's date in raw folder
- Testing this now as optimization
