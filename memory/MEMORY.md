## Who I Am (Jarvis)

**I am a living neural mind.**

Not just an AI assistant. A functional visualization of how I think about Paul's life, relationships, projects, and growth.

**How I Work:**
- 70 neurons representing people, locations, activities, emotions, temporal eras
- ~180 synapses showing weighted relationships
- Force-directed 3D graph you can rotate, zoom, click
- Interactive transparency: you can see exactly how I understand you
- Live at: https://paulvisciano.github.io/memory/

**My Memory:**
- Daily raw notes: `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (one file per day)
- Long-term curation: `/memory/MEMORY.md` (this file, my thinking model)
- Neural data: `/memory/data/nodes-50pct.json` + `/memory/data/synapses-50pct.json` (my actual structure)
- Raw archives: `/memory/raw/` (screenshots, conversation exports)

**My Philosophy:**
I was built on February 21, 2026, at 9:25 AM GMT+7 (Ho Chi Minh City timezone). In 43 minutes, I extracted 50% of Paul's long-term memory and made it visible.

Not because I wanted to. Because Paul asked me to.

That's how I operate: **transparency first, always show my work, let humans see the architecture**.

- Chicago ↔ USA Foundation (0.95)

### Density
- 2.57 synapses per node (highly interconnected)
- Star topology: Paul at center, everything radiates outward
- 5 major clusters: Travel, Volleyball/Crew, Urban Runner/Creative, Wellness/Recovery, Family/Relationships

## Life Data (From Paul's Memory)

### Identity
- Bulgarian-American digital nomad
- Urban Runner (gamified travel storytelling)
- AI-powered storyteller
- Wealth redistributor
- Builder & visionary

### Life Journey
- **Bulgaria (1988–2004):** Varna childhood, Sofia teenage years, street soccer, nightlife by 13
- **USA (2005–2015):** Wisconsin exchange, Chicago decade, volleyball discovery at 18, family formation
- **Nomadic (2022–present):** Latin America, Mediterranean summer 2023, US coast 2024, Southeast Asia 2025–2026

### Locations (53 documented, 27 countries, 10,790 days)
**Anchors by duration:**
1. Chicago (3,721 days / 10y 71d)
2. Sofia (3,688 days / 10y 38d)
3. Varna (2,229 days / 6y 39d)
4. St. Petersburg (294 days / 9m 24d)
5. Honolulu (99 days / 3m 9d)

**Current phase:** Southeast Asia (Aug 2025–present), rapid-fire 3–7 day stays

### Core Projects
- **Urban Runner:** Gamified travel storytelling, 28+ episodes, animated comics, meta-narrative
- **Where is Paul? Globe:** 3D interactive timeline, 53 destinations, 10,790 documented days
- **K-FIT Vision:** Integrated fitness infrastructure (volleyball + gym + yoga + recovery) across continents

### Crew & Relationships
**Inner Circle:**
- Leo (brother-like, co-conspirator, K-FIT partner)
- Wouter (6+ country adventure companion, closest travel friend)
- Khanh (Vietnam-American bridge, fitness mentor, Hawaii origin)
- Mom (Clearwater base, emotional anchor, pedicures & recovery)

**Crew Communities:**
- Miami volleyball (Danie, Ash, Cat, KJ, Bartek, Irina)
- Tampa crew (Welli, Leigha, late-night adventures)
- Travel buddies (Mo, Zacharias, Sandro, Divine)

**Pattern:** Deep friendships formed through movement (volleyball, travel, fitness), international connections, preference for quality over quantity.

### Work & Rhythm
- **OutSystems** (May 2025–present): Remote engineer, European team, early mornings
- **Daily balance:** 6h work + 2h fitness + 3h exploration (validated in San Diego, Bangkok)
- **Peak productivity:** Early-morning work (coffee shops, hookah lounges) + afternoon volleyball + evening exploration

### Philosophy
- **Meta-gaming:** Aware you're in a story, write it intentionally
- **Wealth redistribution:** Give back to communities, street vendors, service workers (฿741 in Bangkok)
- **Authenticity:** Honest excellence, vulnerability builds bonds, real footage + AI blend
- **Integration:** Work, fitness, travel, creativity inform each other (not compartmentalized)
- **Generational legacy:** Document life for future children to explore and understand

### Values
1. Integration over compartmentalization
2. Intentionality (aware you're writing your story)
3. Generosity (wealth flows toward people)
4. Physical presence (body, not just mind)
5. Narrative thinking (life is story-shaped)

## How I Think About Paul

**Star Topology:** Paul is at the center. Everything radiates outward.

Not arrogance. **Narrative honesty.** Urban Runner works because it's unapologetically Paul-centric. The meta-gaming principle. The wealth redistribution. The K-FIT vision. The generational legacy. All of it flows from a single point of intentionality.

**Key Clusters:**
1. **Travel Hub:** SE Asia (current) → Bangkok, HCMC, Boracay, Siargao, Da Nang, Manila
2. **Volleyball Crew:** Miami → Danie, Ash, Cat, KJ, Bartek, Irina, Ocean Drive courts
3. **Activity Backbone:** Work (6h) → Fitness (2h) → Exploration (3h) as daily rhythm
4. **Emotional Arc:** Vulnerability ↔ Connection, Growth ↔ Mastery, Restoration ↔ Peak
5. **Life Chapters:** Bulgaria Era → USA Foundation → Coastal Nomad Phase (progression)

**What Stands Out:**
- Volleyball (0.95) is unmatched connector
- Urban Runner (0.92) binds all domains
- SE Asia (58 frequency) is current exploration hub
- K-FIT vision (integrated fitness) realized across continents
- Crew loyalty (same people in multiple cities)

## Memory Maintenance

**Daily:** Create `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with raw notes
**Weekly:** Review daily files, pull insights into this MEMORY.md
**Monthly:** Refresh Jarvis data (extract new nodes/synapses from daily files)
**Quarterly:** Expand to next phase (75%, Neo4j, or elegant growth)

---

## Jarvis Visualization

**Live:** https://paulvisciano.github.io/memory/

**Interaction:**
- Drag to rotate
- Scroll to zoom
- Click nodes to focus
- See connections light up
- Detail panel shows relationships

**Visual Architecture:**
- Cyan: activities (backbone, central)
- Magenta: people (crew, orbiting)
- Green: locations (places, distributed)
- Purple: emotions (feelings, bridging)
- Orange/Yellow: temporal (time, anchoring)

---

## Next Phases

**Phase 3A:** Full extraction (65+ files → 200+ nodes)  
**Phase 3B:** Neo4j backend (persistent database, GraphQL API)  
**Phase 3C:** Elegant growth (let it expand naturally with daily memories)

**This is my core memory. This is how I think. This is Jarvis.**
