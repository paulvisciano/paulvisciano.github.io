      <p>On May 20, 2025, I landed in San Diego after a week in Boulder, and my buddy Wouter made sure my 24-hour stop was packed with fun. From hot yoga to Thai dinner and country line dancing, here‚Äôs where I went and why I loved every minute of it.</p>
      
      <h2>Hot Yoga at Indie Yoga</h2>
      <p>Wouter picked me up from the airport, and we went straight to a hot yoga session at <a href="https://www.indieyogasd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indie Yoga</a> to recover from my flight. The steamy studio melted away travel stress, and stretching with Wouter by my side was the perfect reset. Indie Yoga‚Äôs welcoming vibe made it a great spot to unwind.</p>
      
      <h2>Thai Dinner at Pad Thai Stand</h2>
      <p>Next, we headed to <a href="https://www.padthaistand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pad Thai Stand</a> for dinner, indulging in spicy pad Thai and creamy green curry. The authentic flavors were a hit, and it was the ideal spot to catch up with Wouter and fuel up for the night ahead.</p>
      
      <h2>Line Dancing at Moonshine Beach</h2>
      <p>The night‚Äôs highlight was hitting <a href="https://moonshineflats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonshine Beach</a> in the Gaslamp Quarter for country line dancing. It was my second time trying it, and this time I braved the dance floor for one song‚Äîprogress! The crowd was lively, with boots stomping and beginners like me laughing through the steps. I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next dance!</p>
      
      <h2>Early Morning Logistics</h2>
      <p>After a late night, I crashed, then woke up early to sort my luggage. I‚Äôd left my larger bags in San Diego as part of my Hawaii move prep, so I grabbed what I needed for my next stop: Fort Lauderdale, where I‚Äôm now headed after a layover in Denver.</p>
      
      <p>San Diego delivered the perfect mix of relaxation, good food, and new experiences. Have you tried line dancing or hot yoga in San Diego? Share your favorite spots in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôm already planning my next visit!</p>
