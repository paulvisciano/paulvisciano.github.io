      <p>On May 20, 2025, I landed in San Diego after a week in Boulder, and my buddy Wouter made sure my 24-hour stop was packed with fun. From hot yoga to Thai dinner and country line dancing, here‚Äôs where I went and why I loved every minute of it.</p>
      
      <h2>Hot Yoga to Recharge</h2>
      <p>Wouter picked me up from the airport, and we went straight to a hot yoga session to recover from my flight. The steamy studio‚Äîpossibly a spot like <a href="https://www.corepoweryoga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CorePower Yoga</a>‚Äîmelted away travel stress, and stretching with Wouter by my side was the perfect reset. [Note: Please confirm the studio name or link.]</p>
      
      <h2>Thai Dinner Delight</h2>
      <p>Next, we headed to a local Thai restaurant for dinner, indulging in spicy pad Thai and creamy green curry. San Diego‚Äôs Thai scene is amazing, with spots like <a href="https://www.saffronsandiego.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saffron</a> serving authentic flavors. It was the ideal spot to catch up and fuel up for the night. [Note: Please confirm the restaurant name or link.]</p>
      
      <h2>Line Dancing at Moonshine Beach</h2>
      <p>The night‚Äôs highlight was hitting <a href="https://moonshineflats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonshine Beach</a> in the Gaslamp Quarter for country line dancing. It was my second time trying it, and this time I braved the dance floor for one song‚Äîprogress! The crowd was lively, with boots stomping and beginners like me laughing through the steps. I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next dance!</p>
      
      <h2>Early Morning Logistics</h2>
      <p>After a late night, I crashed, then woke up early to sort my luggage. I‚Äôd left my larger bags in San Diego as part of my Hawaii move prep, so I grabbed what I needed for my next stop: Fort Lauderdale, where I‚Äôm now headed after a layover in Denver.</p>
      
      <p>San Diego delivered the perfect mix of relaxation, good food, and new experiences. Have you tried line dancing or hot yoga in San Diego? Share your favorite spots in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôm already planning my next visit!</p>
