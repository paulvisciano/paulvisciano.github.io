He's adventurous without being reckless, social without needing the spotlight, and grounded even when life gets chaotic. Wouter and Paul have crossed continents together — from Medellín to Miami, Germany to Cuba, Dubai to Abu Dhabi — collecting stories through late nights, intense conversations, workouts, beaches, and moments that only happen when you travel with someone you fully trust. He has a strong physical presence but an even stronger sense of loyalty. He's the type who shows up, adapts fast, and turns unfamiliar places into home bases. Currently living in Valencia, Spain, Wouter has his eyes set on South Beach, Miami — drawn to the energy, movement, and sun. He represents momentum, brotherhood, and the kind of friendship that evolves alongside personal growth. In the Urban Runner universe, Wouter is not a side character — he's a parallel path, a fellow traveler, and part of the core tribe that makes the journey real.",

    bio: "Boy is raw social momentum — the kind of person who turns any quiet night into a story without ever meaning to. Leo's brother and a social catalyst who creates momentum just by being present. Outgoing, high-energy, charismatic, and shamelessly social. A natural womanizer in the most effortless way — not calculated, just instinctual. Extremely comfortable talking to anyone, anywhere. Thrives in group settings, nightlife, and spontaneous plans. Bold without being insecure; playful rather than aggressive. Acts first, thinks later — but rarely in a way that causes damage. Loyal to his brother Leo, often pulling him into more chaotic social situations. He's not introspective or philosophical — he's kinetic. Movement, people, noise, energy. When Boy is in a scene, the probability of meeting new people spikes, nights extend longer than planned, and the story shifts from observation to participation. He brings Davao street confidence into every city he appears in. Friendly and open with Paul, instantly familiar. Less about deep talks, more about shared experiences. Pulls Paul out of analysis mode and into action. Represents a version of freedom rooted in social instinct rather than self-optimization. Primary base: Valencia (Davao). Strongest presence in Davao, group travel scenes, and nightlife arcs.",

    bio: "Jeandel is the city girl who took the leap to island life, bringing a mix of youthful energy, drama, and genuine connection into a short but memorable chapter of the Urban Runner story. Warm, easygoing, and playful. Emotionally present, but young and still navigating her own boundaries. Open to new experiences, but can bring a bit of drama due to her age and life stage. Met in Manila through Bumble, where she quickly became a consistent part of daily life: coffee runs, downtime, and a slower, more lived-in rhythm. She agreed to come to Siargao, which turned the Manila mission into a successful crossover from city to island life. In Siargao, she brought a mix of joy and challenge. Paul stepped into a provider role, which felt rewarding but also a bit draining at times. Her youthful energy (around 23) added emotional intensity to the experience. Serves as the emotional and narrative payoff of the Manila mission, proving that finding someone genuine wasn't just a fantasy. A character who transitions from one environment to another, adding depth and relational complexity. A short-term companion who brought both enjoyable moments and challenges, ultimately helping clarify what Paul does and doesn't want in a longer-term partner. Primary arc: Manila transitioning into Siargao.",
